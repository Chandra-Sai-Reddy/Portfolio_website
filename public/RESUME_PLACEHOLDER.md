# Add Your Resume

Please add your resume PDF file to the `/public` folder with one of these names:
- `Chandra_Sai_Reddy_Resume.pdf` (currently configured)
- `resume.pdf`

Once added, the Resume button in the social sidebar will link to your actual resume.

## How to add your resume:
1. Place your PDF resume in the `/public` folder
2. Update the path in `/components/floating-socials.tsx` if needed
3. The resume will be accessible at `http://localhost:3011/your-resume-name.pdf`
